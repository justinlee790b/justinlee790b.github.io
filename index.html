                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Heya! My name is Justin Lee, a Korean American QA Analyst based in Metairie, Louisiana. I currently work at 
                    <a href="https://www.testroniclabs.com" target="_blank">Testronic Laboratories</a>, where I own QA coverage for Valorant, focusing on characters, progression, and match services to ensure a smooth and balanced gameplay experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I bring experience across multiple QA roles — from managing test cases and databases to leading comprehensive test passes for unreleased Unreal Engine projects. My work blends technical precision with a deep understanding of player expectations, shaped by years of competing at a high level in Valorant and fighting games like Skullgirls.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I’m passionate about quality, competitive integrity, and creating polished, player-first experiences. With a B.S. in Computer Science from California State University, Northridge, and an ISTQB Foundation certification, I combine structured testing methodology with an authentic love for gaming and improvement through iteration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I’m not working, you can usually find me traveling across the country to compete at major fighting game tournaments!
