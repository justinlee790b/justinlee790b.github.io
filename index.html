                <h2>About Me<br /></h2>
                <p>
                    Hi! My name is Justin Lee, and I’m a graduate of Cal State Northridge with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science. 
                    I am a highly motivated and aspiring professional game developer with a passion for creating engaging and immersive 
                    gaming experiences. In addition to my development background, I am also a professional fighting game player with 
                    multiple high placements and medals in competitive tournaments, particularly in Tag Fighters like Skullgirls. 
                    This competitive experience has given me a unique understanding of game mechanics, balance, and player engagement, 
                    which I apply to my game development projects. 
                    With hands-on experience in game engines like Unity and Godot, I have a solid foundation in programming, 
                    problem-solving, and Quality Assurance. I have worked on independent game projects and performed QA for indie 
                    fighting games. My technical skills include debugging, iterative testing, and collaboration with development teams, 
                    ensuring that games are not only functional but also fun and competitive. 
                    I’m driven by a strong desire to contribute to the gaming industry, and I’m constantly looking for opportunities to 
                    grow as both a developer and player. I bring a detail-oriented, creative, and passionate approach to every project 
                    I undertake.
