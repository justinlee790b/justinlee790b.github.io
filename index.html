                <h2>About Me<br /></h2>
                <p>
                    Hi! My name is Justin Lee, and I’m a graduate of Cal State Northridge with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science. 
                    I am a highly motivated and aspiring professional game developer with a passion for creating engaging and immersive 
                    gaming experiences. In addition to my development background, I am also a professional fighting game player with 
                    multiple high placements and medals in competitive tournaments, particularly in Tag Fighters like Skullgirls. 
                    This competitive experience has given me a unique understanding of game mechanics, balance, and player engagement, 
                    which I apply to my game development projects. With hands-on experience in game engines like Unity and Godot, I have a solid foundation in programming, 
                    problem-solving, and Quality Assurance. I have worked on independent game projects and performed QA for indie 
                    fighting games. My technical skills include debugging, iterative testing, and collaboration with development teams, 
                    ensuring that games are not only functional but also fun and competitive. 
                    I’m driven by a strong desire to contribute to the gaming industry, and I’m constantly looking for opportunities to 
                    grow as both a developer and player. I bring a detail-oriented, creative, and passionate approach to every project 
                    I undertake.

        <p>Using the first 10 minutes of data from High Rank League of Legends Ranked matches, I was able to create a data mining algorithm that is able to accurately predict the outcome of the match.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collected and pre-processed data from ranked matches for analysis.</li>
            <li>Developed a prediction algorithm using Python and data science libraries.</li>
            <li>Tested the model's accuracy and refined it based on feedback.</li>
            <li>Documented the findings and created a user guide for the algorithm.</li>
